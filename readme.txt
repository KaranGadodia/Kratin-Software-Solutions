Good mental health helps you enjoy life and cope with problems. It offers a feeling of well-being and inner strength. Just as you take care of your body by eating right and exercising, you can do things to protect your mental health. 

Mental health plays an very important role in life. so taking it into consideration as a primary precaution, in the prototype i tried to develop something for elderly which not only guide and help for diseases prevention but also a develope a mental health with the help of quotes and tried to motivate.
I focused on primodial and primary stages of prevention of 4 diseases which are very common in India. Also the prototype is designed for general public, though i was needed to make the prototype for Sunita Sharma and was asked to identify one use case, but i thought that making it for general and developing it then can result a better solution, if not for now but after it can.
